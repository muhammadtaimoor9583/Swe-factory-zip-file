Create logger without automatic registration
It is treacherous that if one wants to create loggers on the spot or have loggers with the same name, they have to do manually everything that `create` does (choose async or not, set level, flush policy, etc). Same things for many other functions whose documentation starts with "Create and register"...

Personally I do not foresee a case when I will need to register my loggers, so automatic registration is just an impediment. 

Some proposition for backward compatible changes:
- a global flag (`set_automatic_registration`) to disable registration in convenience functions
- an optional argument added to `create` (and maybe every other function automatically registering)
- extra functions which would not register, naming is tricky, `create_local` ? `create_noregister`?
- have the constructor of `logger`lookup the different global variables like `create` does (most intuitive, but casting for `async_logger` would be an issue)
... ?
