Request: post installation runnable tests
Hello,

I'm updating the spdlog package for Debian and I'm no longer easily able to run the tests against the installed headers due to the removal of the standalone `tests/Makefile`.

Here is the current setup
```
# this is after copying the contents of the tests directory from the libspdlog-dev package to the # temporary working directory
cmake -DSPDLOG_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DSPDLOG_BUILD_TESTS_HO=ON .
make CFLAGS=-DSPDLOG_FMT_EXTERNAL
make test
```

And the current result

```

CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:58 (add_executable):
  Policy CMP0028 is not set: Double colon in target name means ALIAS or
  IMPORTED target.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0028" for policy details.
  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  Target "spdlog-utests-ho" links to target "spdlog::spdlog_header_only" but
  the target was not found.  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an
  IMPORTED target, or an ALIAS target is missing?
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
