tsan false warnings for mpmc_blocking_queue::dequeue_for
gcc 11.3.0 on Ubuntu 22.04 reports "data race" and "double lock of a mutex" for `mpmc_blocking_queue::dequeue_for`

This is most probably due to this gcc bug - https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla//show_bug.cgi?id=101978

Replacing timed [wait_for](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/blob/edc51df1bdad8667b628999394a1e7c4dc6f3658/include/spdlog/details/mpmc_blocking_q.h#L58) with `std::condition_variable::wait` avoids the tsan warnings.

This of course should be fixed in gcc, but I am curious what is the reason for wait_for in the first place? Do you see any issues with replacing `wait_for` with `wait`?
