The test executable `spdlog-utests` was found and executed, but no tests were selected. This suggests the issue is with the test selection logic in the eval script, not the build environment. Please verify the actual Catch2 tags used within `tests/test_registry.cpp` for the specified commit (7e022c430053f71c3db80bf0eb3432392932f7e3). Once identified, update the `./tests/spdlog-utests` command to use the correct tag or a more precise test specifier (e.g., by test case names or by specifying the file path directly if supported by Catch2's command-line interface for that version).",

This is necessary to inspect the `TEST_CASE` definitions and their associated Catch2 tags to determine the correct filter for test execution. This information will inform the 'write_eval_script_agent' on how to modify the test command.",
