Navigate into the directory where the `spdlog-utests` executable is located, which is `/testbed/build/tests/`.\n2. Execute the `spdlog-utests` binary directly, passing the Catch2 filter `\"[pattern_formatter]\"` as an argument.\n\nReplace the line `ctest -R \"pattern_formatter\" --output-on-failure` with:\n```bash\ncd /testbed/build/tests/\n./spdlog-utests \"[pattern_formatter]\"\n```\nEnsure the exit code `rc` is captured from this specific command.",
