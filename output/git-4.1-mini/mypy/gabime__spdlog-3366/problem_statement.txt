Missing test for __APPLE__ chooses buggy SunOS/Solaris workaround in utc_minutes_offset
spdlog uses the function `utc_minutes_offset` in the `z_formatter` to format the `'%z'`-part of a format string (UTC-offset) when logging time. The function has three implementations, one of which is chosen at compile time via marcro defines (Windows, SunOS/Solaris, default):

https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/blob/3335c380a08c5e0f5117a66622df6afdb3d74959/include/spdlog/details/os-inl.h#L268-L271

This test doesn't detect Apple platforms, which have had the `tm_gmtoff`-field at least since [Mac OS X 10.0](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/ctime.3.html), and also doesn't detect [POSIX.1-2024](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/basedefs/time.h.html) conforming systems, which are also required to support `tm_gmtoff`.

On Apple and POSIX1.-2024 platforms, this has the unfortunate effect to use the SunOS/Solaris fallback, which doesn't compute the correct value if the passed value of `tm` isn't the current system time, i.e. `localtime(::time())` (#3351).

I suggest to fix this by changing the test to something like
```c++
    #if defined(sun) || defined(__sun) || defined(_AIX) || \
        (defined(__NEWLIB__) && !defined(__TM_GMTOFF)) ||  \
        (!defined(__APPLE__) && !defined(_BSD_SOURCE) && !defined(_GNU_SOURCE) && \
            (!defined(_POSIX_VERSION) || (_POSIX_VERSION < 202405L)))
    // 'tm_gmtoff' field is BSD extension and it's missing on SunOS/Solaris
```
